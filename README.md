It is incredibly annoying to constantly google .gitignore templates for langauges!

So this CLI is meant to very quickly create .gitignore file in the current directory. 

# Usage

Very simply:
```
ignore python
```
will create a .gitignore file for python.

```
ignore rust
```
will create a .gitignore for rust and so on and so forth. 



You can call it multiple times and it will add them together into a single file.
